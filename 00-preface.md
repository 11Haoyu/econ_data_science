# Preface



[R-Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) is an official manual
maintained by the R core team.
It was the first document that I perused painstakingly when I began to learn R in 2005.
After so many years, this is still the best starting point for you to have a taste.
