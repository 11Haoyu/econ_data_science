# Econ5181: Data Science for Economists



## Introduction

The is a data science course with focus on economic problems. The data operations and analytics will be demonstrated in the `R` language.
After completing this course, students are expected to be fluent in the programming language and be able to independently conduct data
analysis.

This course is design for students with economics training while are new to heavy duty data tasks.
Programming experience is helpful, but not prerequisite.
